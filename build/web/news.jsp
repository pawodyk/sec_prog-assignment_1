                    <p>WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)- In an Oval Office meeting that White House aides described as "friendly but strained," President Obama politely asked President-elect Donald Trump to wait until he is officially sworn in to begin destroying the world. According to the aides, Obama said that, while he understood that Trump was eager to create potentially cataclysmic diplomatic crises around the world, tradition dictated that he wait until he is actually President to do so.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Obama cited the example of George W. Bush, who waited until he took the oath of office before wreaking destruction on a massive scale.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>"There'll be loads of time for you to do stuff like that," Obama reportedly said.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>During the meeting, which lasted nearly an hour, Obama repeatedly asked Trump "if he understood what was being said to him," the aides reported. After the meeting, Trump spoke briefly with reporters but cut the session short to "jump on a phone call with Kim Jong-un."</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>"He's a terrific guy, he's doing just a terrific job over there," Trump said, of the North Korean leader.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Obama did not take questions from reporters but was later seen sitting at his desk, holding his head in his hands.</p>
